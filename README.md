quadcopterarduino
=================

Arduino code for a quadcopter which uses an mpu 6050 imu to read accelerometer , gyro and magnetometer readings and run it through a PID control system in order to make changes to the quadcopters rotor speeds.A kalman.h file is also included so that the user can use his own accelerometer plus gyro instead of using the mpu6050
